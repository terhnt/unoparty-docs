## About

Unoparty is close to release, but is still in a testing phase ( development ) - This is to ensure when mainnet launch happens there is little to no bugs.

**When will mainnet unoparty be released!?**

We have not yet announced a date, it will be this year most likely within a few months, to stay updated follow the
- [Unobtanium news twitter](https://twitter.com/unobtanium_uno)
- [Join the Official Unobtanium Telegram](https://t.me/unobtaniumuno)
- [Join the Official Unoparty Telegram](https://t.me/unoparty)
- [Join the Unobtanium discord](https://discord.gg/TBA) - TBA

**NOTE: Burn period will last roughly 30 days, so if you hope to create some XUP make sure to stay tuned for updates!!**

## Accessing Testnet - Using Unowallet

Currently our testnet unowallet is located at: https://unoparty.io?testnet=1  
**NOTE:** Ensure that the url has ?testnet=1 at the end, as unoparty.io will take you to the mainnet wallet ( and is currently not running until release ).

The page should clearly state TESTNET on multiple parts of the page.
![Check-Testnet Image](/img/tutorial/testnet/checkiftestnet.png)  
**NOTE:** if you don't see the the parts circled in the image above, you have probably loaded the mainnet wallet, click [here](https://unoparty.io?testnet=1) for testnet.

## Creating wallet  
Creating a wallet is the same on both mainnet and testnet, you can get an indepth tutorial by clicking [here](/docs/wallets/tuts/getting-started)

## Get some Testnet UNO

- The [unobtanium telegram channel](https://t.me/unobtaniumuno) has a bot that will give you testnet uno.
  - 1. Join the channel
  - 2. type ```/gettestnet <TESTNET ADDDRESS HERE>```
  - 3. Sometime's the bot's not 'active' to use it when its not active type ```/testunotipbot@gettestnet <TESTNET ADDDRESS HERE>```
- The [unobtanium telegram channel](https://t.me/unobtaniumuno) has many users that are happy to send you some, just ask and post your testnet wallet address.
- Reply to the [unobtanium news twitter](https://twitter.com/unobtanium_uno)
- You could run a unobtanium testnet node and mine some testnet uno yourself ( there is not many miners on testnet atm so should be relatively easy with any PC ).

## How to burn Testnet UNO for XUP

Pretty simple, once you have unobtanium you can click on the arrow in corner of the UNO showing in your wallet and click ```Burn for XUP```  
An alternative way is send 1-5 Testnet UNO to ```UUnoPartyXburnTestnetXXXXXXXXFEeN4``` ( Unoparty TESTNET burn address ).  
**NOTE:** you can only burn 5 UNO per address.

## Creating an asset

To create a named asset you require ```0.5 XUP```, a subasset is ```0.25 XUP``` and a numeric asset is Free, Creating any asset will cost a small amount of uno as its a tx sent on the Unobtanium blockchain.

[Click HERE](/docs/wallets/tuts/create-token) to see an in-depth tutorial for creating an asset on mainnet (its the same).

## Using other features of unowallet

If you have created an asset, you can now;
- Send that to another address,
- Pay dividends to anyone holding that asset (perhaps xup, uno or another asset you hold)
- Create a dispenser ( turns your address into a vending machine, once sent X amount of UNO it will automatically send token/s to the sender )
- Sell/Trade your asset on the dex for XUP or any other created asset on Unobtanium.
- Buy another asset or XUP on the dex ( can offer your asset for them ).
- View your asset on testnet-unoparty.xchain.io (coming soon).
- View your asset using the Unobtanium telegram tipbot.

Tutorials will soon be added for the above stuff, but feel free to try stuff yourself.  
**REMEMBER:** Testnet is free! so is the best time to try stuff and if you run out of testnet uno - You can always get more!
